        kinds of certificates they get.</div>

      <div class="subheader-text">Summary / Findings</div>
      <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="body-text">I found out that most Coursera courses offer a “COURSE” certificate, with
          “SPECIALIZATION” and “PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE” also available. The courses are mostly for beginners or those
          at an intermediate level, not so much for advanced learners.</div>
        <div class="body-text">The study shows which organizations have a lot of students, with “SPECIALIZATION”
          certificates being tougher and “PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE” certificates for beginners only. It seems that the
          easier courses get better ratings, while the harder ones don’t, maybe because they’re not as common or people
          expect more from them.</div>
        <div class="body-text">I also noticed that some courses have the same name but are actually different, which
          means we need to look closer at those. “COURSE” certificates are the most common, and it looks like people
          like getting certificates that show they’re good at certain skills or subjects.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Most courses are easy or medium-hard, which means Coursera has something for everyone.
          The study also found a small link between how students rate courses and how many sign up. But just because two
          things are linked doesn’t mean one causes the other; there could be other reasons why more students sign up.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">To sum up, this analysis gives us a full picture of what Coursera offers, including what
          kinds of certificates people like, how hard the courses are, and how ratings and student numbers are
          connected.</div>
