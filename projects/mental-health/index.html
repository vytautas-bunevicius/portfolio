      <div class="body-text">In this project, I analyze mental health survey data in the tech industry using Python
        libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Gensim, and Plotly, along with SQL for data querying and manipulation.
        The study examines attitudes towards mental health, the occurrence and distribution of reported mental health
        disorders, and the availability of resources in the workplace. I delve into trends, correlations, and insights
        that contribute to a better understanding of mental health issues within the tech sector. I have also created
        interactive graphs with Plotly to visualize different aspects of mental health in the tech industry. </div>

      <div class="subheader-text">Summary / Findings</div>
      <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="body-text">Mental health discussions surged in 2017 and 2018, but plateaued in 2019. The discussion
          of "mental health" and related terms increased significantly between 2017 and 2018, reaching a peak of 38% in
          2018. This suggests that awareness of mental health issues is growing in the workplace. However, the trend
          reversed in 2019, with the percentage of respondents mentioning mental health dropping to 34.65%. This could
          indicate that the initial surge in discussions was due to a specific event or campaign, and that interest has
          since stabilized.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Female participation in mental health discussions increased alongside the trend. The
          percentage of female respondents who mentioned mental health issues also increased during this period, rising
          from 19.6% in 2014 to 30% in 2018. This suggests that women may be more likely to openly discuss mental health
          concerns in the workplace. However, female participation declined slightly in 2019, raising questions about
          the underlying factors behind these trends.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Smaller companies engaged more in mental health discussions than larger ones. During
          periods of peak mental health discussions, smaller companies were more likely to have employees mentioning
          these issues in their responses. This could be due to higher workloads or stress levels in smaller
          organizations, leading to a greater need for open dialogue about mental health concerns. In contrast, larger
          companies with over 1000 employees had fewer discussions about mental health, potentially indicating a lack of
          open communication or awareness of mental health resources.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Resource availability is higher in larger companies, but the correlation with mental
          health disorders is weak. The analysis shows that larger companies (1000+ employees) generally have more
          mental health resources available to their employees. However, the correlation between the availability of
          these resources and the number of reported mental health disorders is very weak. This suggests that there is
          not a simple linear relationship between resource availability and mental health outcomes.</div>
