      <div class="body-text">For centuries, winemakers have relied on experience and tradition to craft exceptional
        wines. But what if we could use science to unveil the secrets behind a truly great bottle? Our project embarked
        on a data-driven exploration of red wine, leveraging machine learning to identify the key factors influencing
        its quality.</div>

      <div class="subheader-text">Summary / Findings</div>
      <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="body-text">Our analysis delved into a dataset of over 1,500 wines, examining their physicochemical
          properties – the measurable characteristics that shape a wine's composition. This included factors like
          acidity levels (both fixed and volatile), alcohol content, the presence of sulfur compounds, and even density.
          Crucially, the dataset also included each wine's quality rating, providing a benchmark for our analysis.</div>
        <div class="body-text">By applying machine learning algorithms, we were able to uncover fascinating connections
          between these chemical properties and the perceived quality of the wine. For instance, we discovered a
          positive correlation between alcohol content and quality. This suggests that wines with higher alcohol content
          are generally perceived as being more enjoyable. However, the story doesn't end there. The analysis also
          revealed a contrasting influence from volatile acidity. Higher levels of volatile acidity correlated with
          lower quality ratings, indicating that an excessive amount can create unpleasant flavors and aromas.
          Interestingly, our exploration also highlighted the importance of specific chemical properties like sulphates
          and various acidity levels, providing a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between chemistry
          and taste.</div>
        <div class="body-text">This wasn't just an academic exercise. We further leveraged this newfound knowledge by
          building models to predict both wine quality and alcohol content based on the analyzed features. These models
          achieved promising accuracy, demonstrating the potential of data science to become a valuable tool in the
          winemaker's arsenal. Imagine a future where winemakers can utilize scientific insights to optimize grape
          selection, fermentation processes, and even predict the quality of their wines before bottling. Our project is
          a glimpse into this exciting possibility, highlighting how data science can join hands with tradition to
          elevate the art of winemaking.</div>
