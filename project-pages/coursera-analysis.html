        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">This exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Coursera dataset uncovers valuable insights. The dataset primarily consists of COURSE certificates, followed by SPECIALIZATION and PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE certificates. Most courses cater to beginners or intermediate learners, with fewer offerings at the advanced level.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The analysis identifies organizations with consistently high enrollments, showcasing the most popular ones. Notably, SPECIALIZATION certificates are associated with higher difficulty levels, while PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE certificates are exclusively at the beginner level.</div>        
          <div class="body-text">Examining the correlation between difficulty levels and course ratings reveals that easier courses tend to have higher ratings. However, advanced courses generally receive lower ratings, possibly due to higher expectations or their limited availability.</div>          
          <div class="body-text">Further investigation into the most common course titles reveals instances of courses with the same name but differing in other attributes, emphasizing the need for a more detailed examination of such cases.</div>        
          <div class="body-text">The analysis highlights the dominance of certain certificate types, with COURSE certificates being the most common, followed by SPECIALIZATION and PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE. Learners on Coursera show a preference for certificates that demonstrate mastery in specific courses or skills.</div>         
          <div class="body-text">In terms of course difficulty distribution, the majority fall into the beginner or intermediate category, indicating Coursera's appeal to a broad audience with varying skill levels.</div>         
          <div class="body-text">The findings also indicate a weak positive correlation between course ratings and the number of students enrolled. However, it's crucial to note that correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may influence enrollment numbers.</div>       
          <div class="body-text">In conclusion, this EDA provides a comprehensive overview of Coursera's course landscape, shedding light on certificate preferences, difficulty distributions, and the interplay between ratings and enrollments.</div>
