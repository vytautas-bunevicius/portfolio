          <div class="body-text">I started by cleaning up the data, removing columns we don’t need, like ‘Unnamed: 0’, and checking for any missing information. Looking through the data, I learned about different music styles, which artists are common, and features of songs like how danceable they are or how loud they sound.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I discovered that Pop is the favorite music style and looked at how often artists show up with their songs. I used statistics to spot unusual songs, find the longest and shortest ones, and see how varied the music styles, artists, and albums are. I noticed that some music styles are more common, while others, like Dreampop/Hip-Hop/R&B, don’t show up as much.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I also looked at how different features of songs, like how loud they are and how much energy they have, are related. To finish, I compared how danceable, loud, and acoustic the songs are in each music style, giving us a glimpse into the variety of music in each category. This whole study gives us a detailed look at the trends and patterns in Spotify’s most popular songs.</div>
